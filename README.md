# FACE_DETECTOR

This is a ML based project.

Firstly it will need DATA CREATION for FACE RECOGNITION(means need some images), here I use the HAARCASCASE_CLASSIFIRE for Detect the FACE.
as we know that images will load at an ARRAY form so i converted the images into an ARRAY and Images should be Coloured but we need to converted it to B&W format
then we dont need for the whole face so i cropped it using CASCADECLASSIFIRE.

Now need to train the algorithm for detection here SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE SVM.
training SVM for FACE DECETION.

Then simply need to test the whole part
